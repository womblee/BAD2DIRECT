# BAD2DIRECT
Converts regular bad google drive links to direct ones

I don't know why I made this, and why it's a repository?

# Usage
```
python convert.py --link https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_XBsQeI__4iDPRDGHbnVIWch9sfnFnCQ0H-yKiKhIy8/edit?usp=sharing
```

*will give you a direct link, you can even use it as a free cdn file hosting or something*
